# Hi, I'm Pardeep K ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer with expertise in Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, PHP, CodeIgniter, Laravel, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Web Accessibility, CI/CD, and Jenkins. With over 5 years of experience in the industry, I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from small websites to large enterprise-level applications.

## Current Project

I am currently working on an Angular project using nx mono repo. I am responsible for building reusable components, implementing state management with NgRx, integrating APIs, and ensuring the application meets the requirements for performance, accessibility, and security. In addition, I work closely with the UX/UI team to ensure that the application provides a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Approach to Programming

I approach programming with a focus on creating clean, efficient, and maintainable code. I follow best practices such as SOLID principles, design patterns, and code reviews to ensure that the codebase is scalable, modular, and easy to maintain. I prefer to use Angular as my primary framework due to its powerful features such as dependency injection, observables, and component-based architecture. However, I am always willing to learn new languages and frameworks to achieve my goals.

## About Me

As a full stack developer, I have experience building real-time applications, customizable applications, and CRMs. I am familiar with the full software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering and design to development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. I am passionate about delivering high-quality software that meets the needs of end-users and business stakeholders.
